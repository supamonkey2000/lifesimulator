Planning for "Game Of Life game" (unofficial title)

Aspects of life to include (represented by classes):
- Life (Main class of the character)
- Car
- Job
- House
- Country
- Education

All config files support using value=*TYPE(Options), where * means random, type can be Integer, Long, Boolean, etc and Options can be a list separated by commas or a range using a hyphen. For cases where no Options are set, Integer and Long use a range of 0-Type.Max. When no String options are set, game closes as the file is invalid

Car:
- Name (String)
- Base Price (int)
- Total Price (int) (determined in-game)
- Engine (4C (0) / V6 (1) / V8 (2) / Electric (3))
- Doors (2 door (0), 4 door (1), 5 door (2))
- Model (Sedan (0), Coupe (1), Sport (2), Deluxe (3))
- Reliability (int) (1-100)
- Insurance payment (Divide total price by 24) (determined in-game)
Price shown to player determined by multiplying each higher class. Example:
	Base = Something reasonable
	Engine = 4C (x1.00), V6 (x1.5), V8 (x1.75), Electric (x2.00)
	Doors = 2 (x1.2), 4 (x1.3), 5 (x1.4)
	Model = Sedan (x1.00), Coupe (x1.5), Sport (x2.0), Deluxe (x2.5)
	Reliability = x1.abc meaning if reliability is 50, it would be x1.50 or x2.00 for 100
	Insurance = take all the previous and divide by 24
Format in .conf file:
	car {
	name=Example Vehicle
	basePrice=16000
	engine=1
	doors=1
	model=0
	reliability=65
	}
